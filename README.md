# LazyCoder

## This Repo

This repository contains code for the lazycoder tool, a snippet provider for
[espanso](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso) written in Rust. This is intentionally simple and I would like to
keep it that way.  Feel free to download and tinker with the code.  Pull requests are welcome.

## Snippet file

The file with the snippets is a plain text file with snippets separated by "\n---\n\n", i.e. an empty line, a line with
three dashes and another empty line.  If you don't want your snippet to be expanded with a new line at the end, don't
add an empty line at the beginning of the separator (just the three dashes right after your snippet and an empty line
after that).
